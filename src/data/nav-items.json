      "Chip is just like any other person in their early 30s. He's figuring out this thing called life. At the end of 2015, he quit his finance job to pursue web development. He has a lot of ideas floating through his head and loves that, with web development, he can create things from scratch.",
      "Some days are good and some days aren't. Let's face it, the struggle's real out here and Chip is subject to the same pressures as anyone else. Tonight, he's had a little too much to drink and needs your help getting home safely."

      "Chip lives in a 2BD 1BA two-story home on the outskirts of San Francisco. No, not South San Francisco, it's still <em>within</em> city limits. Likely built in the early 1900s, it's small compared to what one can find a short drive's away in the suburbs. But commute times into the city these days are ridiculous. Why sit in traffic when public transportation within the city will suffice?",
      "Except, when it's 2:00AM and public transportation isn't running anymore. Now, Chip's two dogs are waiting at home for their owner to return so they can sleep on his warm, comfy bed. Chip needs your help."
